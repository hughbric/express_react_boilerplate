# Express/React App
Initial setup for an Express/React app.

### How to use
#### Server

Navigate to the root file and run `node server/index.js` to start the server.

For development it's better to run `npm run dev` so that the server is automatically restarted when file changes are made.

#### Client

Navigate into the client folder and start the `create-react-app` with `npm start`
